# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to
# create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
orbs:
  node: circleci/node@5.1.0

jobs:
  build: # this can be any name you choose
    executor: node/default # use the default executor defined within the orb
